        <h2> Description</h2>
        <pre>           This braised short ribs recipe has fans. “This has been my go-to recipe for short ribs 
    for as long as I can remember,” says one commenter, “it never fails.” It’s an ideal dish for
    entertaining since short ribs are even better when allowed to rest overnight to reheat the 
    following day.</pre>
        <pre>           The cooking method is simple, building flavor with each step: Start by heading to a
    butcher and ask them to cut bone-in short ribs (which have more flavor than boneless short ribs) into 2"
    pieces. Using a Dutch oven, sear them in batches until cooked on all sides. When you pour off the fat, take
    care not to lose the browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan, which will add even more flavor. Next, 
    sauté some aromatic vegetables in the residual drippings, then toast the tomato paste and flour, which will 
    add a depth of flavor and viscosity to the braise. After deglazing with the red wine (scrape up those browned 
    bits so they dissolve), you’ll simmer the meat on the stovetop for a bit before tucking in lots of garlic and 
    fresh herbs, dousing the whole thing with beef broth, and sliding the braise into the oven.</pre>

            <li>3 Tbsp. all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 750-ml bottle dry red wine (preferably Cabernet Sauvignon)</li>
            <li>10 sprigs flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>8 sprigs freesh thyme</li>
            <li>4 sprigs fresh oregano</li>

            <li>2 fresh or dried bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 head of garlic, halved crosswise</li>
            <li>4 cups low-sodium beef stock</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li style="margin-right: 20%;">Preheat oven to 350°. Season short ribs with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over 
                medium-high. Working in 2 batches, brown short ribs on all sides, about 8 minutes per batch. 
                Transfer short ribs to a plate. Pour off all but 3 Tbsp. drippings from pot.</li>
            <li style="margin-right: 20%;">Add onions, carrots, and celery to pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until 
                onions are browned, about 5 minutes. Add flour and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until 
                well combined and deep red, 2–3 minutes. Stir in wine, then add short ribs with any accumulated 
                juices. Bring to a boil; lower heat to medium and simmer until wine is reduced by half, about 25 
                minutes. Add all herbs to pot along with garlic. Stir in stock. Bring to a boil, cover, and 
                transfer to oven.</li>
            <li style="margin-right: 20%;">Cook until short ribs are tender, 2–2½ hours. Transfer short ribs to a platter. Strain sauce from 
                pot into a measuring cup. Spoon fat from surface of sauce and discard; season sauce to taste with 
                salt and pepper. Serve in shallow bowls over mashed potatoes with sauce spooned over. </li>
